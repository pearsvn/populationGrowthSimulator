# Population Growth Simulator

Using a simple simulator to test the changes in population growth according to various basic factors.\
Some factors include:
* Age
* Infant Mortality
* Fertility
* Agriculture

I will be adding complexity to this simulation over time to visualise various possible outcomes. Feel free to fork this repository and use this code as a foundation for your own exploration.

Also, check out this article on medium for where I found the idea for this code:\
